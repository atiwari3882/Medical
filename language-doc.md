Description:
============
We are interacting with two plugins(pie-register, coursepress) and one theme(protect) at interface so basically we have to put language files in that location.

### Manual process for plugins:-
  * Create **plugins/pie-register/lang/piereg-{locale}.po** file using "poedit application" so that .mo file will generate automatically when save .po file using poedit.
  * Create **plugins/coursepress/languages/cp-{locale}.po** file using "poedit application" so that .mo file will generate automatically when save .po file using poedit. 

### Manual process for theme:-
  * Create **themes/protect/languages/{locale}.po** file using "poedit application" so that .mo file will generate automatically when save .po file using poedit.
